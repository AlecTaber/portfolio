## Installation

In order to install my portfolio, you will need to have Node.JS installed. If you have installed Node.JS, go ahead and clone down my repository using the "git clone" command in your terminal. Navigate to wherever you stored the repository and use the "npm install" command to install the packages required for this application. Once everything is installed, do a "npm run dev" to start to launch the application on a local server!

## Usage

You will use the Navigation bar towards the top of the screen to switch between the About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections of the application. You will find links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter by clicking the icons at the bottom of the screen. If you navigate to the Portfolio section, you will find links to my deployed sites and repositories for each of my projects. The Contact section has a form for you to contact me via email by adding your name, email address, and the message you want me to see (in development)! The resume section has a list of all my skills as well as a button to download my resume!
